Steps I Took to Install SASS
============================

1. Opened the project folder:
   - Navigated into the `alx-intermediate-frontend` repository.

2. Created a new directory for Sass/SCSS tasks:
   - Directory name: `0x03-sass_scss`

3. Installed Sass (local setup):
   - Since Node.js was already installed, I ran the following command:
     
     npm install sass -v 3.7.4

   - This installs Sass version 3.7.4 into the project.

4. Created a documentation file:
   - I then created the file `0-installation-script` where I have documented the installation procedure (this file).

Note:
-----
This setup allows you to compile Sass using the locally installed version.
